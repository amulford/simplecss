# SimpleCSS
## A simple and lightweight css framework

Simple CSS is a super simple css layout framework along the lines of bootstrap just... much simpler. 
It is currently responsive for screen resolutions <= 768px wide. 

## Columns

### Column Widths

Columns are similar to other frameworks. **Use col-n** where **n** is an int > 0 and <= 12
representing the % width of a column.  

### Column Offset

Columns can be offset using **col-offset-n**.
